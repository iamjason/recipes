### NO KNEAD REFRIGERATOR ROLLS
 
* 2 pkgs. active dry yeast
* 2 c. water (110 degrees)
* 1/2 c. sugar
* 2 tsp. salt
* 6 1/2 to 7 cup sifted flour
* 1 egg
* 1/4 cup soft shortening (crisco)
 
In mixing bowl dissolve yeast in water.  
Add sugar, salt, and about half the flour.  
Beat thoroughly - 2 mintues.  
Add egg and shortening.  
Gradually beat in remaining flour until smooth. 
Cover with a damp cloth.  
Put in refrigerator.  
Punch dough down as it rises (occasionally).  
Two hours before baking, roll out amount needed.  
Shape and place on greased baking sheet.  
Cover and let rise until light (1 1/2 to 2 hours).  
Bake at 400 degrees for 12-15 minutes.  
(I always brush melted butter on top after done cooking.  Usually just grab a stick of butter and "butter" the tops of the rolls.)
